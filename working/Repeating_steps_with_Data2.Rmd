#  <span style="color:blue"> A bit more on Looping 



# Loops can be "nested" on loop inside the other

Example: Calculate NPV for

* a range of different interest rates and 
* a range of damages 
* that may be incurred 10 years in the future

Steps

* define inputs (interest rates, damages)
* define output (NPV)
* write the function
* create a data structure to store results where we vary both interest rates and damages
* use nested for loops to fill in the data structure

Try it first...


```{r npvfor, echo=FALSE}

# write a function to compute npv
source("R/compute_NPV.R")
compute_NPV
compute_NPV(20, discount=0.01, time=20)


#generate some input
damages = c(25,33,91,24)
# sensitivity to discount rate
discount_rates = seq(from=0.01, to=0.04, by=0.005)
yr=10

# compute some npv's for different discount rates
# first generate a dataframe to store results
npvs = as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=length(damages), ncol=length(discount_rates)))

# now use a for loop to populate
 for (i in 1:length(damages)) {
         for (j in 1:length(discount_rates)) {
       npvs[i,j]= compute_NPV(value=damages[i],       discount=discount_rates[j],time=yr )

         }
 }
 npvs
 
 
 #some data wrangling
colnames(npvs)=discount_rates
rownames(npvs)=damages
 npvs
 

 npvsg =npvs %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(),names_to="dis", values_to="npv")
 head(npvsg)
 ggplot(npvsg, aes(x=npv, col=as.factor(dis)))+geom_density(size=2)+scale_color_brewer(type="seq", name="Discount")
 
 # how about summing all the damages
 npv.total =npvsg %>% group_by(dis) %>% summarize(t=sum(npv))
 ggplot(npv.total, aes(dis,t, fill=dis))+geom_col() + labs(x="Discount Rate", y="Total ($)")

 
 # we could also do this with sapply
 #generate some input
damages = c(25,33,91,24)
# sensitivity to discount rate
discount_rates = seq(from=0.01, to=0.04, by=0.005)
yr=10

# with purr family, map_dfc runs the function for each value and returns as a data frame 
npvs = damages %>% map_dfc(compute_NPV, time=10, discount=discount_rates)

# with apply (s apply is for a sequence)
alternate_npvs = sapply(damages, compute_NPV, time=10, discount=discount_rates)

 npvsg =npvs %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(),names_to="dis", values_to="npv")
 head(npvsg)
 ggplot(npvsg, aes(x=npv, col=as.factor(dis)))+geom_density(size=2)+scale_color_brewer(type="seq", name="Discount")
 
 # how about summing all the damages
 npv.total =npvsg %>% group_by(dis) %>% summarize(t=sum(npv))
 ggplot(npv.total, aes(dis,t, fill=dis))+geom_col() + labs(x="Discount Rate", y="Total ($)")

 
 
```

# Some other types of loops

* while
  useful for repeating until a condition is met

Example
if a metal toxin in a lake increases by 1% per year, how many years will it take for the metal level to be greater than 30 units, if toxin is current at 5 units


```{r} 

# accumulate pollutant until a threshold - how many years does it take

# initial conditions
yr=1
pollutant_level = 5

# loop
while ((pollutant_level < 30) &&(yr < 1000))  {
  # increase pollutant
pollutant_level = pollutant_level + 0.01* pollutant_level 
# keep track of time
yr = yr + 1
}

pollutant_level
yr

# while loop dangers
# what if it doesn't end....

# see below - I left it commented out -because it will run for ever :)
# you can use controlC to stop

#while ((pollutant_level < 30))  {
  # increase pollutant
#pollutant_level = pollutant_level - 0.01* pollutant_level 
#}


```


Another KEY concept is flow control
In your function you do different things depending on a conditions

CLASSIC example is 

IF then ELSE

If you have multiple conditions we can use case_when
Here's a silly simple example of how it works

```{r}

# if x is 1, return A, if x is 2, return, B, if x is 3, return, C

x=1
case_when(x ==1 ~ "A", x==2 ~ "B", x==3 ~ "C")

x = c(1,2,1,3)
case_when(x ==1 ~ "A", x==2 ~ "B", x==3 ~ "C")
```

# A more interesting example

Lets imagine that we are monitoring pollution in a lake, and we want to write a function that will let us know (flag) a nutrient pollution as high, medium or low

Risk is high if water temperature is greater than a threshold for more than 5 days, 
and mean nutrient concentration is greater than a high threshold

Risk is medium if water temperature is greater than a threshold for more than 5 days
and mean nutrient concentration is greater than a medium threshold


Inputs:   
nutrient concentration for at least 5 days
temperature for at least 5 days
thresholds for temperature and nutrient (with default values)

Output:
Pollution Risk as "low", "med" or "high"

Take a look at classify_lake 
* example of while
* example of flow control with if..else   and case_when

```{r}

source("R/classify_lake.R")

# generate some data to try the function
temperature = runif(min=4, max=35, n=30)
nutrient = runif(min=5, max=40, n=30)

# try it
classify_lake(temperature=temperature, nutrient=nutrient)

# lets pick some numbers we know whould give us a low value
nutrient = runif(min=0, max=5, n=30)
classify_lake(temperature=temperature, nutrient=nutrient)

# now try high
# use repeat to generate the same value multiple times
nutrient = rep(50, times=30)
temperature = rep(25, times=30)
classify_lake(temperature=temperature, nutrient=nutrient)
```
