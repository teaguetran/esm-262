# Comments/Questions on Error Checking




# Steps for running your model over multiple inputs

1. design a data structure to store results: sometimes this is automatic but not always
2. generate the input data
3. apply to the model



# Consider our function that estimates the power required to keep a car moving at a given speed



<span style="color:coral">
**Pb = crolling * m * g * V + 1/2 A * pair * cdrag * V3**
</span>

where *crolling* and *cdrag* are rolling and aerodynamic resistive coefficients, typical values are 0.015 and 0.3, respectively

*V*: is vehicle speed (assuming no headwind) in m/s (or mps) m: is vehicle mass in kg

*A* is surface area of car (m2)

*g* is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2) pair = density of air (1.2kg/m3)

*Pb* is power in Watts


# Code

```{r powerexample}

#' Power Required by Speed
#'
#' This function determines the power required to keep a vehicle moving at 
#' a given speed
#' @param cdrag coefficient due to drag default=0.3 
#' @param crolling coefficient due to rolling/friction default=0.015
#' @param v vehicle speed (m/2)
#' @param m vehicle mass (kg)
#' @param A area of front of vehicle (m2)
#' @param g acceleration due to gravity (m/s) default=9.8
#' @param pair (kg/m3) default =1.2
#' @return power (W)

autopower = function(V, m, A, cdrag=0.3, crolling=0.015,pair=1.2,g=9.8) {
  P = crolling*m*g*V + 1/2*A*pair*cdrag*V**3
  return(P)
}

```

I've also stored the autopower.R function as a file = using the recommended naming convention

**autopower.R**


# Generating data for the function and iterating over that data



Example use: Imagine we want to see how much power is generated given scenario where we know the mean and standard deviation of vehicles speeds


```{r sampling}

source("R/autopower.R")

# generate sample speeds from a distribution
nsample = 100
speeds = rnorm(mean=25, sd=4, n=nsample)

# Step 1  create data frame to store results 
# how many simulations, what do you want to keep

#create a dataframe that has rows for each model run
# columns for height, flowrate and power estimate
results = data.frame(speed=speeds, power=NA)

head(results)

# if you only have one input and everything else is the same, R is smart enough
# to create a set of outputs
results$power = autopower(V=speeds, A=25, m=20000)

# ALWAYS look at your results to make sure it make sense
ggplot(results, aes(speed, power/1000))+geom_point()+labs(x="speed in m/s", y="power in kW")
ggplot(results, aes(x="Across Speed",y=power/1000))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="power in kW")

```

# Looping (or repitition) 

Looping is not always automatic 
  * more complex scenarios - number of different values is not the same for all inputs
  * other programming languages

Lets start with the basics of how you do repetition in programming in general
often called looping

```{r loop }

# repeat statement
a=0
for (i in 1:5) {
 a = a+i
}
a

# find the maximum speed
speeds = runif(min=0, max=100, n=300)

maxspeed=0
for ( i  in 1:length(speeds)) {
  maxspeed = ifelse(speeds[i] > maxspeed, speeds[i], maxspeed)
}

maxspeed
max(speeds)


```


# A more complex example of looping in R

Lets **scale** up from a single car to a group of cars on a highway
and use our **autopower** function to estimate a distribution of power 

What might vary?

# Our highway

3 car types 

Imagine with have 3 different car types - and we know how often each occurs:

* car A  mass 20000 kg, area 22 m^2^

* car B mass 65000 kg, area 30 m^2^

* car C mass 38000 kg area 22 m^2^

Mean highway speed is 100 km/hr 


```{r sampling2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}


# generate a structure to store info on our possible cars
possible_cars = data.frame(name = c("A","B","C"),mass=c(10000,65000,38000), area = c(22,30,22))

# first look at how results vary for mean speed say 100km/hr
# do conversion
speed_base = 100 * 0.28

# because I have one mass and area for each car and only 1 speed
# I can estimate power for each car type
# add to the data structure
possible_cars$power = autopower(V=speed_base, A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass)

head(possible_cars)

# show results                         
ggplot(possible_cars, aes(x=mass, y=power, fill=as.factor(area)))+geom_col()+labs(y="Power W", x="Mass (kg)")

```

# Building a highway

What could be the total power consumed if there are 100 cars on this highway each hour,
they are travelling at a range of speeds - mean is 100km/hr and speeds tend to
be log-normally distributed)

How would the total power consumed vary by car
So if all cars are car A; OR all cars are car B OR all cars are car C

We will use *sample* here to generate speeds for our 100 cars and look at different ways to
repeat power calculation for different cars

* repeating by hand
* *pmap* for repetition - a efficient way of looping in R
* *for* for repetition - a more standard way of looping available in many langugaes

# First lets do it 'by hand'

```{r byhand}

# what is I want to estimate average power use given each car

possible_cars

# use sample to generate a distribution of speeds

# assume a log normal distribution of speeds with mean 100km/hr
# recall our function needs speed in m/s not km/hr so we will also do a conversion
# lets get a sample of a 200 speeds- we could also do this by actually measuring speeds

nsample = 200
mean_speed = log(100*0.277)

speeds = rlnorm(mean=mean_speed, sd=0.1*mean_speed, nsample)
summary(speeds)

plot(density(speeds), ylab="Distribution of Speeds in (m/s)")


# how do we run each car for all speeds 

# first lets to it by hand for the first car - the first row in our possible cars matrix
possible_cars[1,]

# we could do it by hand
powerA = autopower(V=speeds, A = possible_cars$area[1], m=possible_cars$mass[1])
# lets look at what we get
summary(powerA)

# next car (row 2)
powerB = autopower(V=speeds, A = possible_cars$area[2], m=possible_cars$mass[2])
# lets look at what we get
summary(powerB)

# next car (row 3)
powerC = autopower(V=speeds, A = possible_cars$area[3], m=possible_cars$mass[3])
# lets look at what we get
summary(powerC)


# we could put this together
powerall1 = cbind.data.frame(powerA, powerB, powerC)
colnames(powerall1)=possible_cars$name


# for plotting sometimes its useful to turn columns in to rows
powerallr1 = powerall1 %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="car", values_to="power")
head(powerallr1)

# quick visualization
# lets save it so that we can compare
method1_plot = ggplot(powerallr1, aes(car,power, fill=car))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("By Hand")
method1_plot



```

# Second using R built in tools

Doing this by hand would be hard if we had many different cars - can we automate?

YES

first lets try *pmap*  

*pmap* is available in the *purr* library

*mapply* is another R option

```{r withpmap}

# the first part, generating speeds is the same
# what is I want to estimate average power use given  each car

possible_cars

# the first part is the same as above
# use sample to generate a distribution of speeds

# assume a log normal distribution of speeds with mean 100km/hr
# recall our function needs speed in m/s not km/hr so we will also do a conversion
# lets get a sample of a 200 speeds- we could also do this by actually measuring speeds

nsample = 200
mean_speed = log(100*0.277)

speeds = rlnorm(mean=mean_speed, sd=0.1*mean_speed, nsample)
summary(speeds)

plot(density(speeds), ylab="Distribution of Speeds in (m/s)")


# how do we run each car for all speeds 
# pmap runs a function for each value in a list of parameters, with other parameters set for each iteration


powerall2 = pmap(list(A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass), autopower, V=speeds)

# lets turn to a data frame for easier graphing
# we can add column names
powerall2 = as.data.frame(powerall2, col.names=possible_cars$name)

# apply family of functions does this to - FYI
# what mapply does is run the function for each row in parameters listed, using values for other parameters listed in MoreArgs EACH time - a column for row in parameter list is returned
powerall2b = mapply(FUN=autopower, A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass, MoreArgs = list(V=speeds)  )
# we can add column names
colnames(powerall2b)=possible_cars$name

head(powerall2b)
head(powerall2)


# for plotting sometimes its useful to turn columns in to rows
powerallr2 = powerall2 %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="car", values_to="power")
head(powerallr2)

# quick visualization

method2_plot = ggplot(powerallr2, aes(car,power, fill=car))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("pmap")
method2_plot

# put plots side by side
# to confirm that they look similar
ggarrange(method1_plot, method2_plot)

# compare values
head(powerallr2)
head(powerallr1)

# not exactly the same - why?
# recall that we sample speeds!

# but we can compare means (also using  map :)
# map runs the function (here - mean), over each column 
# they are close but still not exact, so statistics such as means and quantiles are # similar, and relative difference between cars is the same
powerall1 %>% map(mean)
powerall2 %>% map(mean)

# upper 90% quantile
powerall1 %>% map(quantile, probs=0.9)
powerall2 %>% map(quantile, probs=0.9)
```

# Third - classic looping *for*

*pmap* works quickly but it is unique to R
Other programming language (and R) use what are called loops - where repetition is more explicit

Lets do this one more time using a *for* loop

```{r withforloop}

# the first part, generating speeds is the same
# what is I want to estimate average power use given  each car

possible_cars

# use sample to generate a distribution of speeds

# assume a log normal distribution of speeds with mean 100km/hr
# recall our function needs speed in m/s not km/hr so we will also do a conversion
# lets get a sample of a 200 speeds- we could also do this by actually measuring speeds

nsample = 200
mean_speed = log(100*0.277)

speeds = rlnorm(mean=mean_speed, sd=0.1*mean_speed, nsample)
summary(speeds)

plot(density(speeds), ylab="Distribution of Speeds in (m/s)")


# how do we run each car for all speeds 
# we use a for loop to cycle through
# we need to create a data frame to store results - as above
# one column for each car and one row for each speed

powerall3 = as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=length(speeds), ncol=nrow(possible_cars)))
# because we don't initialize it - values are NA
head(powerall3)

# how many cars area there
nrow(possible_cars)
# for loops use an index - in this case "i" but you could use anything - it repeats
# anything between the {} for each values of i between 1 and nrow(possible_car) (which is 3 in our case)

# index in to a matrix (like powerall3) is by row and column powerall3[2,5] is 2nd row and 5th column
for (i in 1:nrow(possible_cars)) {
  powerall3[,i] = autopower(A=possible_cars$area[i], m=possible_cars$mass[i], V=speeds)
}

# now it looks like above
head(powerall3)
# we can add column names
colnames(powerall3)=possible_cars$name

# plotting is the same as above

# for plotting sometimes its useful to turn columns in to rows
powerallr3 = powerall3 %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="car", values_to="power")
head(powerallr3)

# quick visualization
method3_plot = ggplot(powerallr3, aes(car,power, fill=car))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("For Loop")

ggarrange(method1_plot, method2_plot, method3_plot, nrow=3)

powerall1 %>% map(mean)
powerall2 %>% map(mean)
powerall3 %>% map(mean)

```




# Steps for running function over multiple inputs 


1. design a data structure to store results: sometimes this is automatic but not always
2. generate the  data (or read it in)
3. find ways to repeat things efficiently
  * *purr* family of function in R
  * more generally looping (*for*, *while*, ...others)
  
# Assignment 2b

Working in the groups that you used for assignment 2b - and your existing autopower function; 

* add some error checking to your function; save in its own file as usual
* In an Rmarkdown document, using the cars that I generated in class (see Class4_Using_functions_with_data.Rmd on Gauchospace), 

* recreate *possible_cars*, add an additional car with mass 30,000 kg, surface area 10m2

* create a random sample of 100 highways each with a different rolling coefficient; , sample the rolling coefficients from a uniform distribution with a minimum value of 0.01 and a maximum value of 0.03, sample 100 different highways

* use a *for* loop to compute the power for each of 100 different highways for each car in *possible_cars* -  for all calculations consider only a single speed -  120 km/hr. We are assuming this is the average speed driven on all highways

* create a box plot of power consumed for each car type (where the boxes will show ranges across the different highways)

* use *pmap* to repeat your calculations and create a second boxplot
