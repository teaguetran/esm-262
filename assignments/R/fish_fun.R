## Assignment 4
## Function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items
# common = most common fish
# rare = rarest fish
# total = total number of fish
# input data should be a factor

#  include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a title giving the total number of fish caught.  Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.

fish_fun <- function(species, common, rare, total){
  common = which.max(summary(species))
  rare = which.min(summary(species))
  total = length(summary(species))
  return(list(common = common, rare = rare, total = total))
}
